For project 3, we created three functions in Haskell.

The first:
  skips through a list, and prints out every nth element, for all n <= the length of the list.
  ie "Hello!" -> "Hello!", "el!", "l!", "l", "o", "!"
  
The second:
  Finds all loal maxima in a numerical list
   ie (1, 4, 2, 5, 3) -> (4, 5)
   
The third:
 Takes a list of numbers 0-9 and prints a histogram with the occurences of each
