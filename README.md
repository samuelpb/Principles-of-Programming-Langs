# Principles-of-Programming-Langs
My code from Rutgers' Principles of Programming Languages course, in Python and Scheme

First Project:
    Implement a matrix multiplication calculator, a Binary Search tree, a reverse Polish Notation Calculator,
    and a deterministic finite automation (DFA). This was all done in python, as it is an imperitive programmin language.
   
Second Project:
    Implement a spell checker using Scheme and Racket, to learn how to use a functional programming language.
 
Third Project:
    Implement three functions in Haskell

Fourth Project:
    Implement a simplified hangman game using IO functionality of Haskell.
